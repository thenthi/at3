# Progress in Unity
**Encounter 4 - Vibrant Garden**

![garden](garden.png)

***Design Project***

For this final design project, I created a peaceful flower field—a space meant to represent tranquility, beauty, and self-recognition. Unlike the emotional weight and tension of previous encounters, this scene is calm and inspiring. The goal is for the player to feel a deep sense of peace and acknowledgment of their growth after everything they’ve overcome.

Gently swaying flowers move with the breeze, creating a soft, natural rhythm that reinforces the sense of stillness and serenity. At the center of the garden, there is a mirror—a key symbolic element. This mirror allows players to see themselves as they are now: strong, resilient, and full of light. It’s a quiet moment of reflection, where success isn’t just an end, but something personal and meaningful.

***Using 3D Objects***

To bring this environment to life, I began by using a cube in Unity to create the ground surface of the scene. For the mirror, I downloaded a model from Sketchfab, then added a plane to simulate the reflective surface. Using Unity’s built-in tools and materials, I adjusted the settings so that the player could see their own reflection, reinforcing the theme of self-recognition. As for the flowers, I also sourced 3D models from Sketchfab. After importing them, I duplicated the models and arranged them across the field, taking time to make sure they were spaced naturally and looked visually pleasing as a whole. This careful placement helped shape a beautiful, immersive space where the player could feel calm and inspired.

Although this encounter is visually simple, it carries strong emotional meaning. It’s a symbolic end to the journey—where after going through confusion, despair, and effort, the player finally stands in a place of peace and self-worth.

# Change in Unity

**Encounter 3 - Study Room**

![study](study.png)

***Design Project***

In this phase of the project, I made a key decision to change the original design for Encounter 3. Initially, I had a different concept in mind, but as I started building it, I ran into several problems—mainly with object placement and the lack of strong, clear visual direction. The scene didn’t feel right, and it didn’t reflect the kind of emotion or impact I was aiming for. Rather than pushing forward with something I wasn’t satisfied with, I chose to redesign the encounter entirely.

The new concept is a study room, which represents the theme of effort, growth, and joyful learning. I wanted this space to reflect a more uplifting and motivated atmosphere, symbolizing the hard work that comes after emerging from emotional struggle. This room now serves as a turning point in the player’s journey—calmer and more focused, with a strong sense of purpose.

***Using 3D Objects***

Like in my previous encounters, I started by using a Cube to form the base structure of the room. I then turned to Sketchfab to find and import bookshelf and desk models, which helped define the academic and reflective tone of the space. After that, I duplicated and arranged these models carefully to create a room that feels organized but still full of life and personality.

To enhance the mood, I added ceiling lamp models and used point lights inside them to actually illuminate the room. This small detail made a big difference, as the soft, warm lighting helped bring a sense of comfort and inspiration to the environment. The overall result is a space that feels welcoming, motivating, and aligned with the message I wanted to express: that effort leads to growth, and that learning is part of the journey toward self-fulfillment.

# Sounds in Unity
![sound1](sound1.png)

For Encounter 1, which takes place inside a dark, disorienting maze, I carefully selected a sound that enhances the player’s emotional state while navigating the space. The background sound I used is designed to create a sense of confusion, anxiety, and mental tension. The ambient audio features subtle, unsettling tones that shift and echo slightly, making it hard for the player to feel grounded or certain of their surroundings. This helps reinforce the core idea of the maze—not knowing which direction is right and feeling mentally lost. The soundscape plays a huge role in deepening the emotional impact of this encounter, pushing the player to stay alert and heightening the feeling of unease as they search for a way out. Overall, the sound helps tie the environment, gameplay, and emotional narrative together, making the maze feel not just physically confusing, but psychologically overwhelming as well.

In Encounter 2, I focused heavily on using sound to reinforce the emotional weight of the space. This encounter is designed to represent deep hopelessness and emotional collapse, so I chose a creepy, unsettling sound as the background audio. The creepy atmosphere makes the room feel oppressive and emotionally heavy, aligning perfectly with the story I want to tell. It's not just an environment the player walks through—it’s an emotional moment that challenges them to confront darkness and fear, just as I have in my own experience.

To add more emotional texture to Encounter 2 – The Room of Despair, I included an additional layer of sound in one shadowy corner of the room. In that space, the player can hear soft crying and gentle whispers, almost as if they’re coming from nearby—but never fully clear. These sounds were added not to scare, but to create a sense of emotional pressure and quiet unease. The crying suggests inner sadness and vulnerability, while the whispers feel intimate yet slightly disturbing, like thoughts that echo in the back of one’s mind during difficult moments. This audio detail helps make the space feel more personal and emotionally layered. It doesn’t overwhelm the player, but it gently amplifies the atmosphere, making them feel as though they’ve stepped into a place full of heavy emotions—just enough to be unsettling, but still grounded in quiet reflection. Combined with the darker ambient sounds and the soft hopeful tone near the hand, this corner adds subtle tension, reinforcing the emotional journey without relying on fear alone.

 While most of Encounter 2 – The Room of Despair is filled with creepy and unsettling ambient sound to reflect feelings of fear and emotional darkness, I made a deliberate choice to add a small but powerful contrast in one corner of the room. In that specific area, I introduced a gentle, bright sound—a soft, calming tone that subtly cuts through the oppressive atmosphere. This is the sound of hope, representing the moment of salvation I previously described, symbolized by the reaching hand in the center of the space. This sound isn’t loud or overwhelming. Instead, it gently calls the player in, offering emotional relief and drawing them toward the symbol of comfort and rescue. It mirrors how, even in the darkest moments, there can still be a quiet light guiding us forward—just as my family and loved ones have been that guiding presence in my own life. By layering in this hopeful audio element, I aimed to create a more emotionally complex experience. The contrast between despair and hope becomes not just visual, but deeply immersive through sound.

In Encounter 3 – Study Room, I added a sound that promotes motivation and reflects the spirit of relentless effort. This sound creates a feeling of perseverance and striving, like a gentle reminder that the player is pushing forward, despite the darkness behind them. The sound is not overwhelming or dramatic; rather, it’s a steady, uplifting melody, symbolizing the quiet effort of studying late into the night. It’s the kind of sound that makes the player feel empowered and hopeful, aligning perfectly with the message of this room: learning, persistence, and never giving up.

For the final encounter, I chose a sound that brings a strong sense of achievement and emotional fulfillment. This space represents the moment of success—the reward after all the effort, struggles, and emotional battles the player has faced throughout the journey. The sound I used carries a calm but uplifting tone, symbolizing peace, pride, and inner strength. It gives players the feeling that they have finally reached their goal, and that all their hard work has led to something meaningful. As the player stands in front of the mirror in the flower field, the music gently emphasizes that this is a moment of self-recognition—they’re not just seeing their reflection, but seeing the successful, transformed version of themselves.
