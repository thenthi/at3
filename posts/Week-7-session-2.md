In the next lesson, teacher taught us about tools in Unity like how to inport terrian, change the camera into various shapes and how to color the terrian or alter its texture. Moreover, teacher also instructed us how to move then camera in 3D space in order to help us designed all encounters more eassiy, character controller and it could be viewed from different angles. 
# Decision for Assignment 3
After thinking about some ideas for this project, finally because of time constraints, I've chosen to limit the game to four encounters: Maze, Dark Room, Insight Room and Vibrant Garden. The encounters each represent my emotions throughout the journey: first panic, then a sense of relief, followed by curiosity and learning, and finally a feeling of peace.

Encounter 1: Maze - symbolizes confusion and lack of direction, feel nervous, panic.

Encounter 2: A dark room with a hand reaches out to rescue - feel saved, rescued, like a saviour.

Encounter 3: Room of blurred insight (Books flying around, symbols floating in the airâ€”representing ideas and inspiration) 

Encounter 4: A vibrant garden in full bloom, with a mirror standing among the flowers - An expression of personal awakening and the discovery of a clear path forward.
