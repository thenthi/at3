# Activity in class
![mountain](mountain.png)
In the next lesson, teacher taught us about tools in Unity like how to inport terrian, change the camera into various shapes and how to color the terrian or alter its texture. Moreover, teacher also instructed us how to move then camera in 3D space in order to help us designed all encounters more eassiy, character controller and it could be viewed from different angles. 
# Decision for Assignment 3
After thinking about some ideas for this project, finally because of time constraints, I've chosen to limit the game to four encounters: Maze, Dark Room, Insight Room and Vibrant Garden. The encounters each represent my emotions throughout the journey: first panic, then a sense of relief, followed by curiosity and learning, and finally a feeling of peace.

Encounter 1: Maze - symbolizes confusion and lack of direction, feel nervous, panic.

Encounter 2: A dark room with a hand reaches out to rescue - feel saved, rescued, like a saviour.

Encounter 3: Room of blurred insight (Books flying around, symbols floating in the air—representing ideas and inspiration) 

Encounter 4: A vibrant garden in full bloom, with a mirror standing among the flowers - An expression of personal awakening and the discovery of a clear path forward.
# Progress in unity
![map](mapunity.png)
This week, I started building the first prototype of my environment in Unity, based on the layout I sketched last week.

**Main Idea**

I decided to create an ancient castle where the player will progress through different sections inside. Each section is a separate encounter or level of challenge that the player must overcome. The layout is linear – there is only one path leading to the exit. This design choice allows me to control the pacing and the overall experience more closely.

**Greybox Progress**

I translated the original layout into Unity and began constructing a rough version of the environment using basic shapes like cubes and planes, which I used to form key architectural elements such as rooms, corridors, and towers. This early greybox stage allowed me to experiment with scale and spatial flow, while also using a Character Controller to test how the player moves through the environment and experiences each area from a first-person perspective. Each encounter is positioned on a different vertical level within the castle, helping to create a clear sense of progression, challenge, and physical elevation as the player advances.

**Progress Update – Testing, Encounter Building, and Incorporating 3D Models**
![map](map2.png)
I’ve successfully used the Character Controller to test movement through the environment, and everything is working perfectly—no issues so far! The flow and navigation feel great, and I’m happy with the progress made so far.

I’ve also started building my encounters, and so far, I’ve managed to complete the basic layout for the first two encounters. I used Unity's built-in 3D Objects to block out the environment, creating the core structure for each area.

In addition to that, I’ve started incorporating models from Sketchfab. I’m using ready-made 3D assets from the platform to enhance the design and add more detailed elements to the scene. This allows me to move beyond basic shapes and bring a bit more realism and complexity to the environment, while still keeping the prototype focused and functional.

I’m excited with how things are shaping up, and I’ll continue refining the encounters, testing interactions, and adding more assets in the coming weeks.

**Next Steps**

I will complete all the encounter areas inside the castle, start incorporating interactions such as doors, triggers, and environmental storytelling, and take notes on the player's experience in each section to better balance difficulty and flow, while continuing to update with images and notes for each area in future posts, and I welcome any feedback on the layout or encounter design.
