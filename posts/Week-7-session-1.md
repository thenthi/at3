# Activity in class
**Solar system**

This one I created it whenever we had a new lesson about 3D, I tried to get used to 3D by creating solar system. I thought that 3D is quite hard but it's really interesting. 

# Brainstorm for assignment 3
Theme: The Journey of Intellectual Growth and Self-Understanding – From Confusion to Confidence.

Inspired by my own experiences in the past. The final period of high school was the most exhausting and challenging time for me, because in my country, we usually have an important exam that determines whether we can get into our dream university. At first, when I wasn’t yet used to the pressure of my final year, I felt completely overwhelmed. But thanks to the support and advice of those around me, I gradually recovered mentally, began a period of continuous hard work, and eventually achieved the success I had hoped for — a high score in the university entrance exam.

**Design Concept – A Tower of Emotions**

For my Assignment 3 project, I decided to design the environment as a tall, vertical tower—a symbolic structure that reflects the emotional journey I experienced during my final year of high school.

The player begins at the lowest level of the tower, where Encounter 1 takes place. This dark and confusing space represents a state of panic and emotional chaos. From there, the player ascends a staircase to the next floor, where Encounter 2 offers a shift in mood—introducing a moment of hope and emotional rescue.

As the journey continues upward, the player reaches a room near the top of the tower for Encounter 3. This is a space of insight and learning, filled with floating books and symbols, representing growth and curiosity.

Finally, the player climbs one last staircase to reach the very top of the tower—Encounter 4. Here, they are rewarded with a peaceful, open space full of blooming flowers and light, symbolizing personal achievement, freedom, and happiness after overcoming all the previous struggles.

This vertical layout allows the emotional tone of the environment to rise in tandem with the player’s physical movement, creating a natural and powerful narrative structure.

#  List of the assets
**Encounter 1 – Maze:**

3D models: Rectangular prism - in order to create entrances, walls, ways and also exits in this encounter.

Sounds: Muffled voices, echoing steps or dynamic lighting (flickering, shifting shadows) to enhance the feeling of confusion.

Spatial arrangements: I will arrange the rectangular prisms to create a maze that has entrance, way and exit.

I make this decision because I want to create the encounter looks confusions, so I think maze is the best option, combine with it is disorienting sound to make the player feel more anxious. 

**Encounter 2 – Dark Room:**

3D models: Black cube, 3D hand model - in order to show 

Sounds: The sound of deliverance.

Spatial arrangements: In a dimly lit room, a single hand extends from the upper corner — representing a glimmer of salvation in the midst of hopelessness.

For Encounter 2, I use these sounds and visuals to create a sense of falling into a deep hole of despair. The hand symbolizes salvation, appearing when the player is at their lowest point.

**Encounter 3 – Insight Room:**

3D models: White cube, books 3D model, sphere, cone, cylinder, pyramid,..

Sounds: cheerful music symbolizing determination.

Spatial arrangements: Books and geometric forms will be placed in a seemingly chaotic yet intentional arrangement — symbolizing an expansive universe of knowledge.

This encounter presents a space overflowing with knowledge — a symbolic environment where the player feels they are healing and absorbing new understanding.

**Encounter 4 – Garden with Mirror:**

3D models: Terrain, garden 3D models, mirror- can be 3D models or create by tools in Unity.

Sounds: Sound of peacefulness and awake.

Spatial arrangements: I will create a garden which has a lot of flowers in this, one mirror stands at the center of garden.

The garden and mirror help the player experiences happiness, delight, and a sense of fulfillment, reinforcing the theme of self-realization, achieve success after a long and difficult journey.
