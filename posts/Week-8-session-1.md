# Activity in class
![activity](image.png)
In this class activity, our teacher challenged us to navigate without using our phones. He gave us an address and asked us to take a photo there. We had 5 minutes to look at the route on Google Maps, then we had to rely entirely on our memory to find the place.

At first, I was nervous because I usually depend on GPS. But as I walked, I noticed more details around me—street signs, landmarks, and turns. I realized I could remember more than I thought.

Reaching the destination felt rewarding. This experience reminded me that sometimes, disconnecting from technology helps us connect better with our environment.

# Continue Progress In Unity
![stair](stair.png)
As I mentioned in Session 1 and 2 of Week 7, my main concept revolves around building a castle environment where players can explore a sequence of structured encounters. The idea is to guide players through a series of spaces, each designed with a unique encounter, while maintaining a strong sense of direction and progression.

To support this, each encounter area is connected by staircases, which not only serve as transitional spaces but also act as a navigational cue. The change in elevation helps the player understand that they are moving from one distinct space to another. This subtle vertical progression reinforces the idea of advancement—both in gameplay challenge and spatial exploration.

By organizing the encounters in this way, I aim to keep the experience clear and focused, while still allowing room for tension, pacing, and discovery as the player ascends deeper into the heart of the castle.

**Encounter 1 -Maze:**

This is Encounter 1—the maze section I mentioned earlier. I’ve nearly completed the entire design for this part of the environment. 

***Design Project:***
The maze serves as the perfect metaphor for disorientation, which fits closely with the tone and story I’m aiming for in the project.

For this section, I focused heavily on creating a dark and eerie atmosphere, one that brings a sense of confusion, unease, and subtle fear as the player navigates through it. The maze was designed to feel cold and unwelcoming, heightening the player's anxiety and encouraging them to move carefully and stay alert.

Design Approach: Maze as Symbol
The maze represents mental disorientation and a loss of control, which reflects key themes in the narrative I’m building. It’s the ideal first encounter to immediately set the tone for what’s to come.

***Using 3D Objects:***
In terms of building, I primarily used Cubes to construct everything—from the floor to the maze walls. This kept things simple in terms of asset management and allowed me to focus more on layout and player experience.

Interestingly, even though the 3D design itself wasn’t too complex, the biggest challenge I faced was designing the path of the maze. It took multiple iterations to get the structure right—to find a balance between complexity and flow, making sure the maze was challenging but not frustrating. I also had to carefully think about how to arrange the paths so that players don’t get stuck but still feel lost enough to experience tension.

This first encounter may look simple in terms of geometry, but the psychological effect it creates is an important foundation for the rest of the game experience.

**Encounter 2 - Dark Room:**

***Design Project:***

For this design project, I created a dark room that feels like a bottomless pit of despair. The goal was to make the player feel a sense of hopelessness, collapse, and entrapment, as if there is no escape. The space is intentionally oppressive, evoking the emotional state of being overwhelmed and lost.

At the center of the room, however, I placed a hand—a powerful symbol of salvation. This hand reaches out in the darkness, representing hope at the moment of deepest despair. It serves as a guiding light, a presence that offers comfort and relief just when everything feels lost.

Personal Meaning Behind the Design
This room is deeply personal to me. It represents my own feelings of hopelessness during difficult times, while the hand symbolizes my parents and loved ones, who have always been there to support and lift me up when I’ve been at my lowest. It’s not just an environment—it's a reflection of real emotion and personal experience translated into spatial design.

***Using 3D Objects***

To build this encounter, I used Unity cubes to form the structure of the room and the doorways. For the hand and the windows, I imported 3D models from Sketchfab to add more realism and detail to the scene.

One of the main challenges in this part of the project was figuring out how to arrange the room in a way that effectively conveyed emotion without overcomplicating the space. It took several tries to get the layout to feel right, both visually and emotionally.

I’m currently close to finishing this encounter—just a few more elements and details need to be added to fully realize the atmosphere I’m aiming for.

**Encounter 3 - Area for study**

***Design Project***

For this design project, I set out to create a study-themed space that represents the idea of effort and motivation in my personal narrative. This room contrasts with the previous encounter, which reflected hopelessness—instead, this one symbolizes the journey upward, a space where the player begins to regain strength, focus, and purpose.

The room is filled with floating books, desks, and chairs, suspended in mid-air to suggest a sense of liberation—a rising motion out of the darkness of despair. This surreal environment is meant to inspire the player, giving the impression that they are now in a place of growth, learning, and unstoppable determination.

This encounter is a metaphor for my own personal efforts and drive. After being pulled out of the lowest emotional point, this space expresses the renewed energy to move forward—to study, to grow, and to fight for a better future. The floating objects are not chaotic; they are symbols of freedom and the inner strength that comes from purpose and learning.

***Using 3D Objects***

In terms of design, I used Unity’s Terrain tool to sculpt the mountains and ground, giving the space a dramatic natural landscape. I then added basic geometric forms like cubes and spheres to act as spatial anchors and abstract elements.

The rest of the environment was populated using 3D models from Sketchfab, including school desks, rulers, and books, to bring the study room to life. These elements helped define the space clearly and reinforce its educational theme.

While the environment is nearly complete, I’m still in the process of refining a few more details to enhance the sense of movement and emotional tone. Overall, this encounter is a turning point in the sequence—where despair begins to turn into hope, and effort becomes the central message.

**Encounter 4 - Vibrant Garden**

This final encounter is still in the conceptual phase, and I haven’t yet started building it in Unity. While I don’t have visuals or a development process to share at this point, the idea and emotional direction for this space are already very clear in my mind.

This encounter will represent a moment of peace, happiness, and fulfillment—the emotional state that comes after overcoming struggle and achieving success. It will stand in contrast to the earlier encounters, especially the maze of despair and the dark pit of hopelessness. Where those were heavy and emotionally intense, this final space will feel light, open, and calming.

The goal is to convey a sense of inner balance and reward, symbolizing what it feels like when all the hard work and emotional battles finally pay off. It’s a space of celebration, not in a loud or flashy way, but in a quiet, meaningful one—where the player can pause, reflect, and feel a genuine sense of accomplishment.
