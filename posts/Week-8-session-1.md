# Activity in class

In this class activity, our teacher challenged us to navigate without using our phones. He gave us an address and asked us to take a photo there. We had 5 minutes to look at the route on Google Maps, then we had to rely entirely on our memory to find the place.

At first, I was nervous because I usually depend on GPS. But as I walked, I noticed more details around me—street signs, landmarks, and turns. I realized I could remember more than I thought.

Reaching the destination felt rewarding. This experience reminded me that sometimes, disconnecting from technology helps us connect better with our environment.

# Continue Progress In Unity

As I mentioned in Session 1 and 2 of Week 7, my main concept revolves around building a castle environment where players can explore a sequence of structured encounters. The idea is to guide players through a series of spaces, each designed with a unique encounter, while maintaining a strong sense of direction and progression.

To support this, each encounter area is connected by staircases, which not only serve as transitional spaces but also act as a navigational cue. The change in elevation helps the player understand that they are moving from one distinct space to another. This subtle vertical progression reinforces the idea of advancement—both in gameplay challenge and spatial exploration.

By organizing the encounters in this way, I aim to keep the experience clear and focused, while still allowing room for tension, pacing, and discovery as the player ascends deeper into the heart of the castle.

**Encounter 1 -Maze:**

This is Encounter 1—the maze section I mentioned earlier. I’ve nearly completed the entire design for this part of the environment. 

***Design Project***
The maze serves as the perfect metaphor for disorientation, which fits closely with the tone and story I’m aiming for in the project.

For this section, I focused heavily on creating a dark and eerie atmosphere, one that brings a sense of confusion, unease, and subtle fear as the player navigates through it. The maze was designed to feel cold and unwelcoming, heightening the player's anxiety and encouraging them to move carefully and stay alert.

Design Approach: Maze as Symbol
The maze represents mental disorientation and a loss of control, which reflects key themes in the narrative I’m building. It’s the ideal first encounter to immediately set the tone for what’s to come.

***Using 3D Objects***
In terms of building, I primarily used Cubes to construct everything—from the floor to the maze walls. This kept things simple in terms of asset management and allowed me to focus more on layout and player experience.

Interestingly, even though the 3D design itself wasn’t too complex, the biggest challenge I faced was designing the path of the maze. It took multiple iterations to get the structure right—to find a balance between complexity and flow, making sure the maze was challenging but not frustrating. I also had to carefully think about how to arrange the paths so that players don’t get stuck but still feel lost enough to experience tension.

This first encounter may look simple in terms of geometry, but the psychological effect it creates is an important foundation for the rest of the game experience.
