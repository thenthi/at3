# Activity in class
![activity](image.png)

In this class activity, our teacher challenged us to navigate without using our phones. He gave us an address and asked us to take a photo there. We had 5 minutes to look at the route on Google Maps, then we had to rely entirely on our memory to find the place.

At first, I was nervous because I usually depend on GPS. But as I walked, I noticed more details around meâ€”street signs, landmarks, and turns. I realized I could remember more than I thought.

Reaching the destination felt rewarding. This experience reminded me that sometimes, disconnecting from technology helps us connect better with our environment.
